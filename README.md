# M.Tech_project
I did this project during my M.tech at IIT Dhanbad (2018-2020)
This project consists of two parts- 1. Mathematical modelling and 2. MATLAB coding
Methods used- Rayleigh ritz (FEM)
Aim is to calculate the buckling load on the FGM Plate based on five different parameters like, Boundary condition, Aspect ratio, Winkler and pasterneck foundation coefficient,nonlocal parameter and power law index(For FGM)
